# AI Question Answering System

This project provides an AI-based system that answers questions from a PDF document. It uses OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 model for natural language processing and Pinecone for storing and retrieving document embeddings.

## Features
- Upload a PDF file and ask multiple questions about the content.
- Uses Pinecone for document indexing and querying.
- OpenAIâ€™s gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 processes the context and generates answers based on document contents.
- Supports automatic creation of Pinecone index if it doesn't exist.
